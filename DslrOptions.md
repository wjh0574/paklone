# Introduction #

The advantage of using a DSLR as the sensor is that there are a number of cheap, sufficiently good, used DSLRs available for purchase at relatively low prices. Some are more easily modified or extended than others, as the DIY / hacker community has discovered effective and unofficial ways to improve upon them. While a DSLR will not give as high quality of a result as a more specialized sensor assembly, it will be good enough for many people, and can cost a lot less than the alternatives.

# Canon #

Canon is a very attractive option simply because of [MagicLantern](http://magiclantern.fm), a firmware addon that opens up a great deal of functionality in Canon DSLRs. There is a development API that can be used to create complex extensions, and a scripting language that can be used to create simpler extensions and automations of existing features.

There is also [CHDK](http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK) for the Canon PowerShot series of point and shoots, some of which can be found used very inexpensively. These will not give results anywhere near as good as a DSLR, and will probably need a diopter attached to their fixed lens. They are at least an option for getting started.


# Image Stabilization #

It might be possible to hack the piezoelectric stage that the sensor is on for interpolation. As the piezo stage is probably faster than the ModalLight (if there is one), make two or more captures per light mode, adjusting the piezo stage each time. This is similar to how the SP-3000 does interpolation.
