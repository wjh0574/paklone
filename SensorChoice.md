# Line Sensor #

## Advantages ##

  * Easier to achieve sharp focus across the entire frame, as film flatness is only needed over a thin rectangular area.

  * If a Bayered sensor is used in conjunction with an IR sensor for ICE, no modal light source (filter wheel / switchable LED array) is needed.

## Disadvantages ##

  * Automated surface defect removal (Digital ICE) is most efficiently done with two separate sensors, one Bayered sensor with an IR blocking filter, the other with an IR pass filter.

  * If a monochrome sensor is used with a modal light source (filter wheel or switchable LEDs), the entire light cycle must be gone through for every single scan line. The modal light source must be able to cycle very rapidly, achieving stability of output in an extremely short time.

# Area Sensor #

## Advantages ##

  * Since it can capture far more area per exposure, a monochrome sensor and modal light source can be used with great efficiency. Instead of 3000 light cycles per frame, there would only be 2-10 light cycles per frame.

## Disadvantages ##

  * Sharp focus is more difficult to achieve across the entire frame, as focus must be achieved across a broad rectangular area.

  * Difficult to have IR capture without a modal light. Either a filter wheel or switchable LED array would be necessary to avoid the use of both an area and line sensor, which would have to have the exact same length and sensel height on the film plane axis that is perpendicular to the film path. Then there would be all of the usual mounting and alignment issues that go along with using two sensors, but it would be somewhat easier since precision is not as critical for the IR mask.
